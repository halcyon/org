* Strategies
** Missed money is better than lost money
** Binary non-earnings events
   - FOMC Minutes - 1PM CST (almost monthly)
     - SPY,TLT
   - Weekly Petroleum Supply - WED 9:30AM CST
     - XOP, USO, XLE
** Broken Wing Butterfly
   - Manage at P50
** Covered Calls
   - Sell at 30 delta
** Calendar Spreads
   - Use a Put Calendar Spread (using puts is better)
   - 30-35delta strike - 20-40 DTE for short, 50-70 DTE for long
   - Since a calendar spread can be hurt by too much stock movement,
     we tend to manage our winners at around 25% of the debit we paid
     to enter the trade. Waiting too long for additional profits could
     mean stock price movement, which is bad for the position. We
     never route calendar spreads in volatility instruments. Each
     expiration acts as its own underlying, so our max loss is not
     defined.
   - Turn it into a diagonal by choosing different strikes

*** Diagonal Spread
    - Put diagonals for bearish assumption
    - Call diagonals for bullish assumption
    - Find Low IV
    - Expansion in volatility is usually to the downside of the
      market, so you end up with a little bit of a kicker
      directionally when you use puts
    - Choose long option in the back-month that is ITM - choose stronger delta to reduce amount of extrinsic paid for
    - Choose short option in the front-month that is OTM
    - Ensure front-month short option extrinsic is equal to or greater than back-month long option
    - Ensure total debit paid is not more than 75% of the width of the strikes
    - Profit occurs when the long option moves further ITM and gains value, and/or if IV increases
** Strangle Swap
   - Short strangle in front month
   - Long strangle in back month - paid for by short strangle in front month
   - Use in low IV environment to capture IV expansion
** Going Inverted
   - We never open a position inverted, it is *only* a defensive strategy
   - Potential Profit = Total credit - Width between strikes
   - We look to manage inverted spread around 50% to 75% of potential profit
** Earnings setup calendar
   - Purchase long call in backmonth just after earnings
   - Sell short call in frontmonth weeklies at half the number of days to expiration of backmonth
** Expected move
   - Expected move = Underlying Price * IV * sqrt(DTE/365)
   - Crude Oil Expected ove = Price * OVX/100 * sqrt(DTE/365)
** Expected move for earnings
   - Expected move is 85% of At The Money straddle
   - Only works for earnings
** Iron Fly ($5 Wide Variant)
*** Sell in lower priced products
*** Risk 1 to make 1
*** $5 Wide Variant
   - Really only applicable in low IV
   - Sell 2 ATM and buy call and put $5 away from short strikes
   - Manage at 10%
** Lizards
*** Spiked Lizard
    - Peak is ATM
    - Breakeven on downside is at 1SD
    - No upside risk
    - Good for earnings plays
    - Good for regular products in high IV
    - Better for earnings than big lizard because the earnings moves
      are usually understated and this gets us out of the way of the
      move
    - Collect at least $3.00
    - Setup (Synthetic using all puts to get it all in with one trade)
      Sell 2 ATM Puts
      Buy 1 ITM Put at just under the cost of the 2 ATM Puts (paid for by selling the 2 ATM puts)
      Buy 1 OTM Put at the downside breakeven (completing a symmetric butterfly)
      Sell 2 OTM Puts below the breakeven to pay for the OTM breakeven put
*** Big Lizard
    - Sell ATM straddle
    - Buy a call as that is as close as possible to equal to or less
      than the ATM straddle where the total credit collected is
      greater than the width of the call spread
    - If short stock, add the big lizard on top
    - If long stock, add the reverse big lizard on top
*** Jade Lizard
    - Look for a put with about 70 cents in extrinsic value
    - Look for a $1 wide call spread with about 30 cents
    - Never roll a big lizard or a jade lizard out in time - only roll the tested portion
    - First profit target is 50% of max profit, or half of the credit
      that was initially received at order entry.
    - Downside breakeven: Strike Price of short put - credit received
    - Upside breakeven: none
    - A Jade Lizard is a slightly bullish strategy that combines a
      short put and a short call spread. The strategy is created to
      have no upside risk, which is done by collecting a total credit
      greater than the width of the short call spread.
    - A Jade Lizard is traded when a trader has a neutral to bullish
      assumption on a stock, but not extremely bullish since the
      position incorporates a short call spread. The trade is suitable
      for stocks that have sold off and have high implied volatility
      rank (IVR). This allows for more premium to be collected, while
      having no upside risk if the underlying trades through the short
      call spread. For traders who are very bullish on a stock that
      has sold off and has a high IVR, strategies such as short puts
      or covered calls may be more suitable.
    - Mechanical Defense: If the stock trades through the short call
      spread, the short put can be rolled up to collect more
      credit. However, since there is no upside risk when trading Jade
      Lizards, this adjustment isn’t entirely necessary. If the stock
      sells off and tests the short put, the short call spread can be
      rolled down to collect more credit without increasing the upside
      risk

** Rolling into strength
   | Position       | Moneyness? | Strength           |
   |----------------+------------+--------------------|
   | CC/CP          | ~          | UL Moves - Favor   |
   | Naked Single   | ITM        | UL Moves - Favor   |
   | Naked Single   | OTM        | UL Moves - Against |
   | Short Straddle | Call ITM   | UL Moves - Lower   |
   | Short Straddle | Put ITM    | UL Moves - Higher  |
** Straddle
*** Break Even
    - Downside: Subtract initial credit from Put strike price -
    - Upside: Add initial credit to the Call strike price -
*** Management
    - The first profit target is generally 25% of the maximum profit. This
      is done by buying the straddle back for 75% of the credit received
      at order entry.
*** Defense
    - With premium selling strategies, defensive tactics revolve around
      collecting more premium to improve our break-even price, and further
      reduce our cost basis. With short straddles, we don’t have much
      wiggle room because the short options are already on the same
      strikes. One option is to roll the whole straddle out in time, using
      the same strikes. This can be done for a credit, and we will hope
      for the stock price to return to our short strike by the new
      expiration.
** Strangle
*** Starting points are at 16Δ
*** Defense
    - Roll untested side
    - Go inverted if necessary
** Vertical spreads
*** Credit Spreads
    - High IV
    - Long use put spread, Short use call spread
    - Setup with short strike at 30/35 delta
    - Collect 1/3rd the width of the spread
    - You can estimate your initial POP for a credit spread by taking
      the inverse of the credit received divided by the width of the
      spread. For example if you collect $0.75 on a $1 wide spread,
      your initial POP will be 1-(.75/1) = 25%. This is because in
      order to collect such a large amount of credit, you have to be
      very close to ATM (at the money) or even ITM (in the money).
*** Debit Spreads
    - Low IV
    - Long buy the call spread, short buy the put spread
    - Long strike 1 strike ITM
    - Short strike 1 strike OTM
    - Pay about 1/2 the width of the spread
    - Pay just slightly under the amount of intrinsic that the underlying is trading for
    - Setup to have a positive theta value
*** Manage winner at 50% max profit
** When to add wings
   We found that it did not pay to add wings in low IVR environments;
   however, it actually decreased the win rate and average P/L of the
   short premium trade by much more than just having the naked
   position on in low IVR. In high IVR, adding wings caused a dramatic
   increase in win rate and average P/L to the extent that the
   increase was greater than that of the naked position.
** IVR
*** High: Above 35%
*** Low: Below 35%
** Iron Condors
*** Sell in higher priced products
*** Managing at 50% in all environments always outperforms
*** Use Fixed Iron Condor in IVR under 35%
*** Use Dynamic Iron Condor in IVR over 35%
** Poor Man's Covered Call
*** 80Δ-100Δ Long Call at further expiration
*** 30Δ Short Call at front-month expiration
** Ratio Put Spread
*** Setup: Long 1 50-delta put, short 2 33-delta puts
*** Manage at 25-50% max profit
*** Strategy
    - We route front-ratio spreads as a means to get into a long or
      short stock positon with a very beneficial breakeven point. We
      tend to use these strategies if we have a price target in mind
      for the underlying. We will usually place our short strike at
      that target, as that would yield max profit at expiration if the
      stock ends up there.
*** When do we manage Ratio Spreads?
     - When the debit spread portion of the trade can be closed for near
       max profit, the debit spread portion can be sold while holding the
       additional short option. If the trader wants to extend duration on
       the position, the short option can be rolled to the next month.
*** Max Profit
    - Distance between long strike and short strike + credit received
*** Breakeven
    - Short put strike - max profit potential
** Volatilty Strategies
   - Strangle: Short Vega, Profits when IV Falls
   - Straddle: Short Vega, Profits when IV Falls
   - Credit Spread: Short Vega, Profits when IV Falls
   - Debit Spread: Long Vega, Profits when IV Rises
   - Ratio Spread: Short Vega, Profits when IV Falls
   - Calendar: Long Vega, Profits when IV Rises
   - Diagonal: Long Vega, Profits when IV Rises
*** Setup
    - Long 50 delta put + Short two 33 delta puts
    - 29% Prob of Larger Profit and 50% Prob of Net Credit = 79% POP
    - Target high IV + advantage from put skew
    - for 45 DTE, expect to hold for about half of 45 days, so roughly 22 days.
    - If the underlying stays around the short strike, we usually like
      to wait for 25-50% max profit
    - If the underlying goes to the net credit profit zone (through the long put) we try to manage for 100%
** IRA Strategies
   - 10/30/10 Iron Condor managed at 50% max profit
   - Jade Lizard
   - Big Lizard
   - Spiked Lizard
